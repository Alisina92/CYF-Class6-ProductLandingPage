      <h1>Welcome to Coffee Night</h1>

        <h3 class="titles">About Us</h3>
        <p id="About">
          <span>W</span>elcome to night cafe where you would experiance the
          taste of real coffee.We are in business since 1970, We have over 40
          years in providing breakfast to our loyal costomers. we have diffent
          types beverages which you are able to see in our Product section.There
          are 3 common ways to make coffee at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long-standing favorite has been a classic drip coffee machine, but
          pour-over coffee at home is becoming increasingly more popular, and
          French press is an easy favorite as well. Find out how to make coffee
          with all three methods with these easy steps. As a general rule, we
          recommend about 15 grams of ground coffee per 8-ounce cup of coffee.
          For four cups of coffee, that's about 60 grams of ground coffee (or
          about 6 coffee scoops or 3/4 cup, though a scale will yield the best
          results).Snobbism among coffee drinkers can rival that of wine
          drinkers, but the fact is that an astonishing world of coffee tastes
          awaits anyone willing to venture beyond mass-marketed commercial
          brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specialty coffees that clearly state the country, region or estate of
          origin can provide a lifetime of tasting experiences. There are two
          major beans on the market-Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are more
          widely produced, have a wider range of flavors and are generally
          considered the "better bean." By all means look for 100% pure Arabica
          beans. The cheap alternatives may contain Robusta beans, noted for
          their higher caffeine content but harsh flavors. "Nasty" is a term
          commonly linked to Robusta coffees by Arabica devotees.
